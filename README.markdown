MiniFu: Write Your Own Concurrency Testing Library
==================================================

This is a tutorial series I am writing about how to make your very own
concurrency testing library in Haskell.  It's called "MiniFu" because
the result will be a simpler version of my [Déjà Fu][] library.

See the `tutorial` directory for previous articles.

Tags relate the code to the articles.  While the git history should be
fairly clear, jumping between tags is probably the easiest way to
follow along.  The tags are:

1. [post-01](https://github.com/barrucadu/minifu/tree/post-01):
   end of the first post
2. [homework-01](https://github.com/barrucadu/minifu/tree/homework-01):
   homework solution for the first post (`CRef` functions)
2. [pre-02](https://github.com/barrucadu/minifu/tree/pre-02):
   some refactoring and an implementation of `readMVar`
